    <h5>My favorite food is Mutter Paneer</h5>
    <p>t is a delicious North Indian dish made with green peas and soft paneer cubes cooked in a spicy tomato-based gravy.
        I love its rich taste and creamy texture, especially when it's served hot with naan or rice.
        The blend of spices in Mutter Paneer makes it flavorful and comforting.
        Itâ€™s my go-to dish whenever I want to enjoy something tasty and satisfying!
        
        Want it in Hindi or a poem style too?</p>
